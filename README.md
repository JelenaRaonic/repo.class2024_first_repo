# repo.class2024_first_repo
This project is challenge 2 (VBA module) and it is stock analysis (changes of tickers) through 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

The loop is created to go through all the stocks for each year and to give us information for each ticker - it's yearly change, percentage change as well as total stock volume.  
Also, for analysis to be more detailed additional coding was done so we can see for each year which ticker has a greasted%increase, greatest% decrease and greatest total volume. Coloring was added for YearlyChange so we can see easily spot if yearly change was negative or positive.

This VBA script was adjusted so it can run on every worksheet at once.

Separate sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx was used to develop the code. In this sheet data set is smaller, therefore testing is much faster. 

It was interesting project to work on, and I appreciate help from Learning Assistant in part where tickers needed to be connected with gratest%increase,greatest%decrease.
